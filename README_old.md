# Band booking and management with Odoo

Custom Odoo modules to help manage music band booking (and more!) with
[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/).

A basic Odoo project usecase with these modules can be found at the
[odoo-band-template](https://github.com/clementmbr/odoo-band-template) repository.

`partner_structure <partner_structure>`_ Distinguish "Structure" partners (Festivals and
Venues for the moment) from classic "Contacts" partners.
`partner_category_type <partner_category_type>`_ Create "Category types" allowing to
make the difference between Strucures categories and classic Contacts categories.
`band_booking <band_booking>`_ Special link between Contacts, CRM Leads and Events along
other small customisations. `web_form_background_color <web_form_background_color>`_
Pure UX module displaying a custom background color in Leads and Events form view.

``band_booking`` is a top-level module, so it is necessary to have all its odoo dependencies available for installation before installing it.

Along with `partner_category_type <../partner_category_type>`_ and `partner_structure <../partner_structure>`_, the module depends on `crm_stage_type <https://github.com/OCA/crm>`_ and `partner_external_map <https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact>`_ from the OCA.
